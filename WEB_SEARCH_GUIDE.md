# 🔍 Web Search Guide

## What's New

AgentAru now has **web search capabilities**! You can search the internet and fetch web page content - all without any API keys.

---

## ✅ Features Added

### 1. **Web Search** (`search_web`)
Search DuckDuckGo and get top results with titles, snippets, and URLs.

**Example queries:**
```
Search for "latest AI news"
What's happening with quantum computing?
Find information about Python 3.13 features
```

### 2. **Fetch Page Content** (`get_page_content`)
Extract the main text content from any web page.

**Example:**
```
Get content from https://python.org
Fetch the article from [URL]
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### In the Streamlit UI:

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Initialize the agent** (click button in sidebar)

3. **Ask web-related questions:**
   - "Search for Python tutorials"
   - "What's the latest news about AI?"
   - "Find information about quantum computers"

4. **Check available tools** - You should now see **6 tools** in the sidebar:
   - ✅ Read File
   - ✅ Write File
   - ✅ List Directory
   - ✅ Create Directory
   - ✅ **Search Web** ⭐ NEW
   - ✅ **Get Page Content** ⭐ NEW

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works:

**Search Implementation:**
- Uses DuckDuckGo HTML search (no API key needed)
- Returns top 5 results by default
- Includes title, snippet, and URL for each result

**Page Fetching:**
- Extracts clean text content from web pages
- Removes navigation, scripts, and styling
- Returns first 2000 characters (summary)

### Privacy & Performance:

- ✅ **No tracking** - DuckDuckGo doesn't track searches
- ✅ **No API keys** - Completely free
- ✅ **Local processing** - All parsing done locally
- ⚠️ **Rate limits** - Don't spam searches (be respectful)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to web-search server"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure beautifulsoup4 is installed
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
```

### "Search returned no results"

**Possible causes:**
- DuckDuckGo temporarily unavailable
- Query too specific
- Network connectivity issues

**Try:**
- Broader search query
- Check internet connection
- Wait a moment and retry

### Tools showing as white boxes

**Fixed!** The new version displays tools as an expandable list with descriptions.

If still showing boxes, refresh the Streamlit app (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R in browser).

---

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before:
- 4 tools (filesystem only)
- No web access
- Local-only information

### After:
- 6 tools (filesystem + web)
- ✅ Web search capability
- ✅ Can fetch current information
- ✅ Still 100% free (no API keys)

---

## 🎨 UI Improvements

The tool display was also improved:

**Old:** White boxes with no labels
**New:** Clean expandable list with:
- Tool name (clean format)
- Click to expand for details
- Full description visible

## 🚀 Next Steps

Try combining tools:
```
1. "Search for Python best practices"
2. "Get content from [top result URL]"
3. "Write summary to python_tips.md"
```

**Your agent can now:**
